# Baseball-Models-Analysis

This project aims to provide Major League Baseball (MLB) teams with a model for classifying MLB All-Stars of players that were drafted in the top 10 rounds and made it to the MLB without using players on field statistics. Two data sources, `pybaseball` and `Lahman Baseball Database`, were used to gather draft ranks, player origin information, organization information, and college information. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gather statistics and visualize data to identify features. The identified features (overall draft pick, draft round, team drafted to, college attendance, length of minor league development, birth country, birth state, and debut age) were then used to train various models. Due to the imbalanced nature of the data (13% All-Stars), the models were trained on both balanced and unbalanced data. Each model underwent recursive feature elimination to identify the most useful features and hyperparameter tuning to increase model performance. The primary metric used to score the model was F1-score and secondary metric was precision. The best performing model was a random forest classifier with an F1-score of 97.9% and precision of 100%. The model was also able to have a mean AUC of 96.6% which indicates that it was not only high performing but also robust.
